### Description

This project is a React-based web application that features a user authentication system, a dynamic leaderboard, and a question-and-answer component for a quiz or polling platform. Users can log in with their credentials to access protected routes, view their performance on the leaderboard, and interact with various questions. The application leverages Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, and a simulated backend service to fetch user data. Additionally, it gracefully handles 404 errors by redirecting users to a dedicated Not Found page when they attempt to access invalid routes. The overall design emphasizes a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation for an engaging user experience
